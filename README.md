# Use of classes, validators, methods, etc.

This is mainly just for me so I can keep better track of what classes, validators, methods, etc. that I use throughout my project and adding descriptions to them to understand them.

| Class, etc. | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| @Target | @Target means the ValidEmail annotation can annotate the specified types | [Here](https://github.com/goob8079/Dogs-Spring-Boot/blob544bfc5fcb7d3ff2240f3e7aaa6772dfbfb52763/src/main/java/com/justice/dogs/login/ValidEmail.java#L14-L15) |
