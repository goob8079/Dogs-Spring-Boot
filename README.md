# Use of classes, validators, methods, etc. 

---

This is mainly just for me so I can keep better track of what classes, validators, methods, etc. that I use throughout my project and adding descriptions to them to understand them.

| Class, etc. | Description | File Location | Line |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| @Target | @Target means the ValidEmail annotation can annotate the specified types | ValidEmail.java | 14 |
